# Odin Recipes & Landing Page

This repository contains my work for two assignments from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/):  

1. **Recipes Project (HTML focus)** â€“ to practice basic HTML structure, linking, and building a small website.  
2. **Landing Page Project (HTML + CSS + Flexbox focus)** â€“ to practice styling and layout using CSS and Flexbox.  

Instead of keeping them separate, I deliberately **combined both projects into one repo** to simulate how projects naturally evolve (from plain HTML â†’ styled with CSS).  
This also shows how incremental iterations build upon each other.
