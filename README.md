# Odin Recipes

This project is an assignment for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) to practice basic HTML structure and linking. It is a simple recipe website that includes a home page and individual recipe pages.

## Project Iterations

### Iteration 1: Initial Structure
- Created the `index.html` file with boilerplate HTML.
- Added an `<h1>` heading titled "Odin Recipes" to the body.

### Iteration 2: Recipe Page
- Created a `recipes` directory to store individual recipe pages.
- Added an HTML file for each recipe (e.g., `pongal.html`,  `dosa.html`, `idli_sambhar.html`).
- Each recipe page includes:
  - Boilerplate HTML.
  - An `<h1>` heading with the recipe name.
  - A link back to the home page (`index.html`).

### Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
- Enhanced each recipe page with the following content:
  - A free image of the dish.
  - A "Description" section with a brief overview of the recipe.
  - An "Ingredients" section with an unordered list of ingredients.
  - A "Steps" section with an ordered list of instructions.

### Iteration 4: Add More Recipes
- Added more recipes (`sambar.html`, `upma.html`) with the same structure as the first recipe page.
- Updated the `index.html` file to include links to all recipe pages in an unordered list.

## Features
- Simple navigation between the home page and recipe pages.
- Clear and consistent structure for all recipe pages.

## How to View
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the recipes.
